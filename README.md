## What was Shoutbox?
Shoutbox *WAS* a Discord bot that connected multiple guilds and multiple people from all over the world into a one big chat,

It used the technology of Discord's own API to use a SET channel which was stored in the Database to broadcast **ANY** messages sent in that set channel.

Messages outside this set channel wouldn't be broadcasted, it was stated multiple times that we never stored **ANY** messages broadcasted throughout the duration Shoutbox existing, it was noted notoriously throughout our Automated Broadcasting System and in our Privacy Policy.


## Who maintained Shoutbox?
It was maintained by everyone at "Shoutbox Development HQ", we had a dedicated staff team to ensure it was always a Respectful and Peaceful safe-zone, especially since the age rating is 13+ years old on Discord, we had to ensure that the enviroment was Kid-Friendly.
