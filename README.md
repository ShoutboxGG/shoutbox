## What was Shoutbox?
Shoutbox *WAS* a Discord bot that connected multiple guilds and multiple people from all over the world into a one big chat,

It used the technology of Discord's own API to use a SET channel which was stored in the Database to broadcast **ANY** messages sent in that set channel.

Messages outside this set channel wouldn't be broadcasted, it was stated multiple times that we never stored **ANY** messages broadcasted throughout the duration Shoutbox existing, it was noted notoriously throughout our Automated Broadcasting System and in our Privacy Policy.


## Who maintained Shoutbox?
It was maintained by everyone at "Shoutbox Development HQ", we had a dedicated staff team to ensure it was always a Respectful and Peaceful safe-zone, especially since the age rating is 13+ years old on Discord, we had to ensure that the enviroment was Kid-Friendly.

## What is this purpose of this repo?
The purpose is to leave our mark upon this earth on what we set out to achieve upon this Project,
And to release the **FULL** Shoutbox Discord Bot framework/src code.

*Source code released at a later date*

## Why are you releasing the source code to this project?
I, Pika, am releasing this source for the simple fact that it caused too many issues, both personal to me and the fact that other people just couldn't follow simple rules.

Its being released mainly for ruining my happiness and destroying my IRL (In Real Life),
By that I mean, my love life, the girl who constantly inspired me everytime I made anything such as this bot.

All my other projects are to remain PRIVATE and anyone who leaks any of the other projects I developed or had hosted on their server, is subjected to a DMCA Claim as they are under my ownership and I have not given anyone permission to distribute those sources.


## What did you achieve on this bot?
We managed to have 50-80 actual active Discord Servers (Guilds) communicating throughout our project,
We had 250 guilds known on the bot with over 300+ active communicating users through out our Global Chatting Network.
